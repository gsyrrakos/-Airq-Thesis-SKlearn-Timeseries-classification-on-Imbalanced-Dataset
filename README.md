This application is part of our thesis with Tina Chrysidou "Pollution monitoring and detection system in an indoor enviroment"
# SKlearn-Classification problem
Timeseries Classification for polution detection using PMS7003 with SVM ,Random Forest and KNN algorithms.
In this app was used Smote Algorithm because of Imbalanced Data.
The creation of Dataset was by monitoring our indoor enviroments for weeks .
